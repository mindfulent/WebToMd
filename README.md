# Web to Markdown Converter

## Author: [Jon Pappas](https://github.com/mindfulent)

## Version: 1.2

A Python-based tool that transforms web content into clean, well-formatted Markdown documents. It uses gpt-4o-mini with its vision capabilities to first analyze the page structure and determine the optimal conversion strategy. For standard web pages, it parses the HTML while comparing it to the screenshot. For pages with complex layouts and low content-to-HTML ratio, it automatically switches to OCR-based extraction for cleaner results. Finally, it reviews the content and references guidelines to ensure the final output meets markdown standards. This tool uses [docs.ell.so](https://docs.ell.so) to orchestrate the process and to permit inspection of the prompts, OpenAI for the LLM calls, Selenium for the screenshot capture and BeautifulSoup for the HTML parsing. Cursor and Claude 3.5 Sonnet were used to build this project.

## Why?

In an era of AI-powered development tools like [Cursor.com](https://cursor.sh), having web content in Markdown format enables collaboration with AI by providing structured, easily referenceable documentation. Markdown's widespread adoption in developer workflows, native rendering in GitHub, and support across various documentation platforms makes it a good candidate for preserving and sharing web content in both a human-friendly and AI-context-friendly way.

For intance, to build this tool I had to use Ell.so. But in order to understand Ell.so, which is very fresh and new, I had to create context files to feed to Claude within Cursor.com to know how to use it properly. This tool was used to create [docs/notes_ell_combined.md][ell-notes] which you can use in other Ell.so-powered projects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Chrome/Chromium browser (for Selenium)
- OpenAI via Ell.so framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mindfulent/WebToMd
cd WebToMd
```

2. Create and configure your environment file:

```bash
# Copy the sample environment file
# Update with your OpenAI API key
cp .env.sample .env
```

3. Set up Python environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the converter:
```bash
# Run interactively
python -m src.convert

# Run with URL argument (using Fireworks.ai documentation as an example)
python -m src.convert --url https://docs.fireworks.ai/getting-started/introduction 

# Run batch processing from config file with a custom prefix (using ALL of Fireworks.ai documentation as an example, 97 pages)
cp archive/configs/fireworks.config.yml src/config.yml
python -m src.convert --config src/config.yml --prefix fennel

# Run analyzer.py to analyze the content of a single URL (using Fennel.ai API as an example 7.34% text-to-HTML ratio)
python -m src.analyzer --url https://fennel.ai/docs/api-reference
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key
- `CHROME_BINARY_PATH`: Path to Chrome/Chromium binary

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Visual Analysis and Strategic Planning Phase**
   - Screenshot capture
   - Visual importance analysis
   - Content area identification
   - Content structure analysis
   - Text-to-HTML ratio assessment
   - Processing strategy determination
   - Recommendations generation   
   - OCR extraction (when recommended)

2. **Content Extraction Phase**
   - Strategy-based extraction (HTML or OCR)
   - Content cleaning
   - Element correlation

3. **Markdown Conversion Phase**
   - Structured conversion
   - Format preservation
   - Quality validation

## Config File Format

The application supports batch processing using a YAML configuration file. Create a `config.yml` file with the following structure:

```yaml
urls:
  - https://example.com/page1
  - https://example.com/page2
  - https://example.com/page3
```

When using batch processing with a prefix, output files will be generated with sequential numbering:

- prefix-01-page1.md
- prefix-02-page2.md
- prefix-03-page3.md

This makes it easy to maintain order and organization when processing multiple related pages.

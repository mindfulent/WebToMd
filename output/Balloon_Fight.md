# Balloon Fight

**Balloon Fight** is an [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_video_game) [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) developed by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) and [HAL Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Laboratory) and published by Nintendo for the [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System). It was originally released for [arcades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game) as *VS. Balloon Fight*, with the console version releasing in Japan in 1985 and internationally in 1986.

The gameplay is similar to the 1982 game *[Joust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(video_game))* from [Williams Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Electronics)[^14][^15]. The home Nintendo Entertainment System version was ported to the [NEC PC-8801](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-8801) in October 1985, the [Sharp X1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_X1) in November 1985, the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) as *Balloon Fight-e* for the [Nintendo e-Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_e-Reader) in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the [Classic NES Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_NES_Series) in Japan on May 21, 2004. It was later rereleased through Nintendo's [Virtual Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console) and [NES Classic Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Classic_Edition). It was released on [Nintendo Switch Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Online) in 2018.

## Gameplay

This section needs additional citations for [verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)[^17]. Please help [improve this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditPage/Balloon_Fight) by [adding citations to reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Referencing_for_beginners) in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

The player controls an unnamed Balloon Fighter with two [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon) attached to his [helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet). Repeatedly pressing the A button or holding down the B button causes the Balloon Fighter to flap his arms and rise into the air. If a [balloon is popped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_popping), the player's flotation is decreased, making it harder to rise. A life is lost if both balloons are popped by enemy Balloon Fighters, if the player falls in the [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water), gets eaten by the large [piranha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha) near the surface of the water, or is hit by lightning.[^16]

There are two modes of play: the 1-player/2-player game where the goal is to clear the screen of enemies, and Balloon Trip where the goal is to avoid obstacles in a side-scrolling stage. The original arcade game does not include Balloon Trip, but all the level layouts are completely different so as to take advantage of vertical scrolling in addition to some minor gameplay differences.

### 1-player/2-player game

Defeat all of the enemies on screen to clear the stage. This mode can be played alone or co-operatively with a second player. Each player starts with three extra lives. The 3DS *Balloon Fight* port comes with the Download Play option, that allows you to play along with a friend that has another 3DS system.

Enemy Balloon Fighters float around the screen and the player must hit their balloons to defeat them. The enemy can also fall into the water or be eaten by the fish while flying close to the water's surface. If an enemy is defeated or falls into the water, a bubble will rise up the screen which can be hit for extra points. As play progresses through the stages, the number of enemies and platforms increases.

Every three stages is a bonus stage, where the goal is to burst all of the balloons that float up the screen from the chimneys at the bottom.[^17]

### Balloon Trip

A single-player game where the goal is to avoid the lightning sparks and collect the balloons, aiming to move up the ranks and compete for the high score. The player starts with one life.

## Ports, sequels, and references

The home [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) version was ported to the [NEC PC-8801](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-8801) in October 1985, the [Sharp X1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_X1) in November 1985, the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) as *Balloon Fight-e* for the [Nintendo e-Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_e-Reader) in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the [Classic NES Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_NES_Series) in Japan on May 21, 2004.[^16] It can also be played in the first *[Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(video_game))*, both through its [Nintendo Space World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World) 2000 demo[^18] and in the final game.

Nintendo released a [Game & Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch) version of the same name, based on the NES version's Balloon Trip mode. The protagonist is "a Balloon Man". Unlike Balloon Fighters, Balloon Men use rocket suits instead of flapping their hands to elevate while holding balloons.

A sequel to *Balloon Fight* called *[Balloon Kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Kid)* was released in October 1990 in North America and on January 31, 1991, in Europe for the [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy),[^19] which expands from the game's roots and revamped it into a full platforming adventure. This title was not released in Japan on the Game Boy, but colorized versions titled as *[Hello Kitty World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty_World)* (published by *[Character Soft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Soft)*) for the Famicom and *Balloon Fight GB* for the Game Boy Color were later released only in Japan.

In September 2001, the game was ported to the [Sharp Zaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Zaurus) series of PDAs.[^20]

[Balloon Fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Fight) and Flipper trophies are obtainable in *[Super Smash Bros. Melee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee)*, and the Flipper is also a usable item, replacing the Bumper from *the previous game*. The Balloon Fighter was considered for a playable role during the development of *Melee*, but the [Ice Climbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climbers) were chosen instead.[^21] The original background music for the Balloon Trip in *Balloon Fight* can be heard in *Melee*’s [Ice Climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climber) stage as alternate music.[^22] The giant fish makes a cameo appearance in *[Super Smash Bros. Brawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl)*. It appears on the *[Ice Climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Climber)*-based stage, the Summit, where it tries to attack the players from the sea.[^23] In addition, a remixed version of the main theme, titled "Balloon Trip" is available for the Summit stage as well. Stickers of the Balloon Fighter and the Balloon Fight Enemy can be collected in *Brawl*. In addition, the Villager from the *[Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing)* series uses the Balloon Fighter's helmet as one of his special moves in *[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U)*. In the 3DS version of the same game, a stage based on *Balloon Fight* appears with the original 8-bit graphics; the same stage returns in *[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate)* and Balloon Fighter appears as a Spirit in said game.

In the *[WarioWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare_(series)) series, some of [9-Volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_WarioWare_characters#9-Volt)'s games are based on *Balloon Fight*. In *[WarioWare: Smooth Moves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Smooth_Moves)*, there is also a minigame functioning as a three-dimensional version of Balloon Trip; players use the [Wii Remote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote) only for the microgame version, and also use the [Nunchuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote#Nunchuk) in the complete 3D Balloon Trip.

The original tech demo for *[Yoshi Touch & Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_Touch_%26_Go)* was called *Yoshi's Balloon Trip*. *Balloon Fight* is the theme for Touch Mode in *[Tetris DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_DS)*, although the mode itself has almost nothing to do with the game other than the music and decorative graphics.[^24]

On April 12, 2007, [Club Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Nintendo) released *Tingle's Balloon Fight* for the [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS), an exclusive game featuring [Tingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingle_(character)), a Nintendo character who originated from the *[The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda)* series. The game is a remake of the home version, featuring the "Balloon Fight" and "Balloon Trip" modes. The levels are expanded slightly to utilize both screens, similar to the arcade game except based entirely around the NES levels. A gallery that contained concept art was also included, where each piece could be unlocked by completing specific in-game tasks.[^25]

The Balloon Fighter appears in *[Super Mario Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Maker)* as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume as part of an update.

*Balloon Fight* has been re-released as part of Nintendo's [Virtual Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console). The game was released in Europe on June 8, 2007, followed by a release in North America on July 16, and Japan on November 12. The game was released on Virtual Console for [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) as part of that system's Ambassador Program in September 2011.

In *[Nintendo Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Land)*, there is an attraction called Balloon Trip Breeze that is very similar to Balloon Trip from the original *Balloon Fight*.

The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console service on January 23, 2013, in North America until February 23, as part of a promotion celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of the original Nintendo Famicom.[^26] *Balloon Fight* became the first [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U) Virtual Console title to be released. In November 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the [NES Classic Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Classic_Edition) (Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).[^27]

The NES version of *Balloon Fight* was re-released as one of the launch titles for [Nintendo Switch Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Online) on September 18, 2018.[^28][^29]

The original arcade version, *[Vs. Balloon Fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vs._Balloon_Fight)*, was ported by [Hamster Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster_Corporation) and released on the [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) as part of the *[Arcade Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Archives)* series on December 27, 2019.

## Release

Similar to other early Nintendo titles, the exact date of the console release is difficult to pinpoint. It was first scheduled for June 1986,[^29] was later changed to August,[^30] but very likely came out in September.[^4]

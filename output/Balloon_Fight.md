## Gameplay

The player controls an unnamed Balloon Fighter with two [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon) attached to his [helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet). Repeatedly pressing the A button or holding down the B button causes the Balloon Fighter to flap his arms and rise into the air. If a [balloon is popped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_popping), the player's flotation is decreased, making it harder to rise. A life is lost if both balloons are popped by enemy Balloon Fighters, if the player falls in the [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water), gets eaten by the large [piranha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha) near the surface of the water, or is hit by lightning[^16].

There are two modes of play: the 1-player/2-player game where the goal is to clear the screen of enemies, and Balloon Trip where the goal is to avoid obstacles in a side-scrolling stage. The original arcade game does not include Balloon Trip, but all the level layouts are completely different so as to take advantage of vertical scrolling in addition to some minor gameplay differences.

### 1-player/2-player game

Defeat all of the enemies on screen to clear the stage. This mode can be played alone or co-operatively with a second player. Each player starts with three extra lives. The 3DS *Balloon Fight* port comes with the Download Play option, that allows you to play along with a friend that has another 3DS system.

Enemy Balloon Fighters float around the screen and the player must hit their balloons to defeat them. The enemy can also fall into the water or be eaten by the fish while flying close to the water's surface. If an enemy is defeated or falls into the water, a bubble will rise up the screen which can be hit for extra points. As play progresses through the stages, the number of enemies and platforms increases.

Every three stages is a bonus stage, where the goal is to burst all of the balloons that float up the screen from the chimneys at the bottom[^17].

### Balloon Trip

A single-player game where the goal is to avoid the lightning sparks and collect the balloons, aiming to move up the ranks and compete for the high score. The player starts with one life.

## Ports, sequels, and references

The home [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) version was ported to the [NEC PC-8801](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-8801) in October 1985, the [Sharp X1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_X1) in November 1985, the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) as *Balloon Fight-e* for the [Nintendo e-Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_e-Reader) in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the [Classic NES Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_NES_Series) in Japan on May 21, 2004. It can also be played in the first *[Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(video_game))* game, both through its [Nintendo Space World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World) 2000 demo[^18] and in the final game.

Nintendo released a [Game & Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_%26_Watch) version of the same name, based on the NES version's Balloon Trip mode. The protagonist is "a Balloon Man". Unlike Balloon Fighters, Balloon Men use rocket suits instead of flapping their hands to elevate while holding balloons.

A sequel to *Balloon Fight* called *[Balloon Kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Kid)* was released in October 1990 in North America and on January 31, 1991, in Europe for the [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy)[^19], which expands from the game's roots and revamped it into a full platforming adventure. This title was not released in Japan on the Game Boy, but colorized versions titled as *[Hello Kitty World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty_World)* (published by *Character Soft*) for the Famicom and *Balloon Fight GB* for the Game Boy Color were later released only in Japan.

In September 2001, the game was ported to the [Sharp Zaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Zaurus) series of PDAs[^20].

## Release

Similar to other early Nintendo titles, the exact date of the console release is difficult to pinpoint. It was first scheduled for June 1986,[^29] was later changed to August,[^30] but very likely came out in September.[^4]
